# Getting started

Before starting the process, we must check if you have CFW.

## CFW Check

1. Hold `select` and boot the system.
2. If the 3DS boots normally, you are good. If you do see a weird screen then continue to [finalizing setup](/finalizing).

## System Firmware Check

1. Open the `System Settings` app from the home menu.
2. Your system version should be on the bottom right of the screen. 

## Find your method

If your version was `11.16.0-49U` then continue with the guide. If not, please update.
